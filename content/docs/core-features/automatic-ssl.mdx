DAMP provides **automatic HTTPS** for all your local projects using Caddy's built-in certificate authority.

<Callout type="success">
  Caddy generates and manages SSL certificates for all your projects.
</Callout>

## Powered by Caddy

DAMP uses [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/) - a modern web server with automatic HTTPS built in.

## How It Works

When you create a new project in DAMP, here's what happens:

```
1. Project Creation
   └─> DAMP creates project: myapp.local
          │
          ↓
2. Caddy Configuration
   └─> Caddy receives reverse proxy config
          │
          ↓
3. SSL Generation
   └─> Caddy generates SSL certificate
          │
          ↓
4. Ready to Use
   └─> Access https://myapp.local securely
```

<Callout type="info">
  All SSL management happens automatically in the background - you don't need to configure anything.
</Callout>

## Certificate Installation

Install Caddy's root certificate once:

### One-Time Setup

<Steps>

<Step>
**Install Caddy Service**

Start Caddy service from the Services page in DAMP. Caddy will automatically create its local certificate authority.
</Step>

<Step>
**Install Root Certificate**

DAMP will attempt to automatically install the root certificate. If automatic installation fails, you can:
- Click "Install SSL Certificate" button in the Caddy management section
- Or download the certificate and install it manually
</Step>

<Step>
**Enjoy Secure Connections**

Once installed, all your `.local` sites will work with HTTPS without browser warnings.
</Step>

</Steps>

<Callout type="tip">
  If automatic installation doesn't work, download the certificate from DAMP and install it as a "Trusted Root Certification Authority" in Windows.
</Callout>

## Features

### Automatic Certificate Generation

Every site you create automatically gets:

- Valid SSL certificate for HTTPS
- HTTP/2 support for improved performance
- Automatic redirects from HTTP to HTTPS
- Vite dev server HTTPS support (for React/Vue projects)

### Certificate Management

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│     Caddy Certificate Authority     │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│  📜 Root CA Certificate             │
│     (Installed once on your system) │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
                │
                │ Signs certificates for:
                ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│       Your Project Certificates     │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│  🔒 myapp.local                     │
│  🔒 blog.local                      │
│  🔒 shop.local                      │
│  🔒 api.local                       │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Why This Matters

Modern web development requires HTTPS:

- **Service Workers** - Only work on HTTPS connections
- **Browser APIs** - Many APIs require secure context
- **Mixed Content** - Avoid HTTP/HTTPS mixing issues
- **Production Parity** - Match your production environment

<Callout type="warning">
  **Without HTTPS locally, you can't test:**
  - Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)
  - Web Push Notifications
  - Geolocation APIs
  - Camera/Microphone access
  - And many other modern features
</Callout>

## Benefits

### For Developers

- Instant Setup - No certificate configuration needed
- No Maintenance - Certificates auto-renew automatically
- Clean URLs - Use `https://` just like production
- Test Modern Features - PWAs, Service Workers, etc.

### For Projects

- Secure by Default - Every project gets HTTPS
- Production-Like - Environment matches real deployments
- HTTP/2 Support - Better performance with multiplexing
- Security Testing - Test HTTPS-only features locally

## Certificate Status

Check your SSL certificate status anytime:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Status</th>
      <th>Meaning</th>
      <th>Action</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Certificate Available</td>
      <td>Caddy CA is active</td>
      <td>None needed</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Root Certificate Installed</td>
      <td>Trusted by your browser</td>
      <td>None needed</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Root Certificate Not Installed</td>
      <td>Browser will show warnings</td>
      <td>Install root certificate</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Certificate Not Available</td>
      <td>Caddy not running</td>
      <td>Start Caddy service</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<Callout type="tip">
  Navigate to Services → Caddy Management to see your SSL certificate status and manage certificates.
</Callout>

## What About Production?

While DAMP uses Caddy's local CA for development:

- Different from production - Production uses real certificates (Let's Encrypt)
- Same behavior - HTTPS works identically in both environments
- Easy transition - Your app works the same when deployed
- Best practice - Develop with HTTPS, deploy with HTTPS

<Callout type="success">
  By using HTTPS locally, you catch SSL-related issues before deployment, making your development workflow more professional and reliable.
</Callout>

## Troubleshooting

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="Browser Shows SSL Warning">
    <b>Solution:</b> Install the Caddy root certificate from the Services page.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Certificate Not Generating">
    <b>Solution:</b> Ensure Caddy service is running and restart your project.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Mixed Content Warnings">
    <b>Solution:</b> Update all <code>http://</code> URLs in your app to <code>https://</code> or use protocol-relative URLs (<code>//</code>).
  </Accordion>
</Accordions>

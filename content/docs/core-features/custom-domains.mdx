DAMP gives every project its own **local domain** using the Windows hosts file. Access your projects with URLs like `myapp.local` instead of `localhost:8080`.

<Callout type="success">
  DAMP generates custom domains for each project and automatically manages your Windows hosts file.
</Callout>

## How It Works

When you create a new project named "myapp", DAMP automatically:

<Steps>

<Step>
**Generates Domain**

Creates `myapp.local` domain for your project
</Step>

<Step>
**Updates Hosts File**

Adds entry to Windows hosts file pointing to `127.0.0.1`
</Step>

<Step>
**Configures Caddy**

Sets up reverse proxy from domain to your container
</Step>

<Step>
**Ready to Use**

Access your project at `https://myapp.local` immediately.
</Step>

</Steps>

## Default `.local` Domain

By default, DAMP uses the `.local` top-level domain:

```
Project Name: myapp
          ↓
Generated Domains:
  • https://myapp.local       (main project)
  • https://vite.myapp.local  (Vite dev server for React/Vue)
```

<Callout type="info">
  The `.local` TLD is reserved for local networks and won't conflict with real internet domains.
</Callout>

## Benefits

  <Card title="Clean URLs" icon={<Link />}>
    Use memorable URLs like `blog.local` instead of `localhost:3000`
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Multiple Projects" icon={<Layers />}>
    Run many projects simultaneously, each with its own domain
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Production-Like" icon={<Server />}>
    Test with real domain names, not ports and localhost
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Automatic Setup" icon={<Zap />}>
    No manual hosts file editing - DAMP handles everything

## Domain Features

### Automatic Hosts File Management

DAMP uses the `hostie` utility to manage your Windows hosts file:

```
127.0.0.1   myapp.local
127.0.0.1   vite.myapp.local
127.0.0.1   blog.local
127.0.0.1   vite.blog.local
127.0.0.1   shop.local
127.0.0.1   vite.shop.local
```

- Automatic Addition - Domains added when sites are created
- Automatic Removal - Domains cleaned up when sites are deleted
- Admin Privileges - Uses UAC elevation for secure modification
- Safe Operations - No manual editing or typos

<Callout type="warning">
  When creating or deleting sites, you'll see a UAC (User Account Control) prompt. This is normal - DAMP needs administrator permission to modify the hosts file.
</Callout>

### Vite Dev Server Support

For React, Vue, and other Vite-based projects, DAMP creates an additional domain:

```
Main Site:        https://myapp.local       → PHP/Laravel
Vite Dev Server:  https://vite.myapp.local  → React/Vue Hot Reload
```

This allows you to:
- Access backend API at `myapp.local`
- Access frontend at `vite.myapp.local`
- Keep hot module reloading working
- Maintain separate HTTPS certificates

## Customizable Domain Extension

Want to use a different domain extension? You can configure it!

### Change Default Domain

<Steps>

<Step>
**Open Settings**

Navigate to Settings → General in DAMP
</Step>

<Step>
**Set Custom Domain** *(Coming Soon)*

Enter your preferred domain extension (e.g., `.dev`, `.test`, `.localhost`)
</Step>

<Step>
**Apply to New Projects**

New projects will use your custom domain extension
</Step>

</Steps>

<Callout type="info">
  Custom domain configuration is coming in a future update. Currently, all projects use `.local` by default.
</Callout>

## How Domains Resolve

Here's the complete flow when you access `myapp.local`:

```
1. Browser Request
   └─> User types: https://myapp.local
          │
          ↓
2. DNS Resolution
   └─> Windows checks hosts file
   └─> Finds: 127.0.0.1 myapp.local
          │
          ↓
3. Local Connection
   └─> Browser connects to localhost:443
          │
          ↓
4. Caddy Reverse Proxy
   └─> Caddy receives request
   └─> Forwards to: myapp_devcontainer:8080
          │
          ↓
5. Your Application
   └─> PHP app responds
          │
          ↓
6. Response
   └─> Caddy returns response to browser ✅
```

## Multi-Site Benefits

With custom domains, running multiple projects works smoothly:

```
Running Projects:
  🌐 portfolio.local      (PHP 8.2 + MySQL)
  🌐 blog.local           (PHP 8.1 + MySQL)
  🌐 shop.local           (PHP 8.3 + PostgreSQL)
  🌐 api.local            (PHP 8.2 + Redis)
```

Each project:
- Has its own unique domain
- Runs in isolation
- Uses different PHP/database versions
- Can be accessed simultaneously

## Cleanup on Delete

When you delete a project, DAMP automatically:

1. Removes domain from hosts file
2. Removes vite subdomain from hosts file
3. Updates Caddy configuration
4. Stops and removes containers
5. Cleans up Docker volumes (if requested)

<Callout type="success">
  DAMP handles all domain management automatically.
</Callout>

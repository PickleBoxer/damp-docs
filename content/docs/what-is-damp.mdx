# What is DAMP?

DAMP is a **modern desktop application** that brings the power of Docker containerization to PHP development with an intuitive visual interface. Built with Tauri v2, DAMP makes it easy to create, manage, and deploy PHP applications without the complexity of traditional development environments.

## Why DAMP?

<Callout type="info">
  **Desktop + Application + MySQL + PHP = DAMP**
  
  A modern take on the classic LAMP/WAMP stack, designed for today's developers.
</Callout>

### Perfect For

- **Beginners** who want to learn PHP without configuration headaches
- **Professionals** who need reproducible development environments
- **Teams** seeking consistency across different machines
- **Anyone** tired of "works on my machine" problems

## Core Philosophy

DAMP believes that development tools should be:

1. **Accessible** - Visual interface that anyone can use
2. **Powerful** - Full Docker capabilities under the hood
3. **Reliable** - Containerized environments that just work
4. **Modern** - Built with latest technologies (Tauri, React, Rust)

<Callout type="tip">
  DAMP uses Docker containers, which means your development environment is isolated, reproducible and consistent from day one.
</Callout>

Setting up your first PHP project with DAMP takes just minutes:

1. **Install Docker Desktop** (if not already installed)
2. **Download DAMP** from the releases page
3. **Create your first site** with a few clicks

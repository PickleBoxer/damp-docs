## Comparison Overview

<Tabs items={['Laravel Herd', 'DDEV/Lando', 'XAMPP/MAMP']}>
  <Tab value="Laravel Herd">
    ### vs. Laravel Herd
    
    | Feature | DAMP | Laravel Herd |
    |---------|------|--------------|
    | **Architecture** | True Docker containers | Binary installation |
    | **Learning Value** | Learn Docker & containerization | Vendor-specific tool |
    | **Production Parity** | Identical to production | Different from production |
    | **Service Flexibility** | Any Docker service | Limited to bundled services |
    | **Team Consistency** | Docker guarantees consistency | OS-dependent behavior |
    
    <Callout type="info">
      **The Verdict**: While Herd is quick to set up, DAMP provides better long-term value by teaching Docker skills and ensuring your development environment matches production.
    </Callout>
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab value="DDEV/Lando">
    ### vs. DDEV/Lando
    
    | Feature | DAMP | DDEV/Lando |
    |---------|------|------------|
    | **Interface** | Visual desktop app | Complex CLI commands |
    | **Learning Curve** | Beginner-friendly | Expert-oriented |
    | **Daily Usage** | Click and go | Memorize commands |
    | **Error Handling** | Clear visual feedback | Terminal error messages |
    | **Onboarding** | Intuitive GUI | Documentation-heavy |
    
    <Callout type="tip">
      **The Verdict**: DDEV and Lando are powerful but require significant CLI expertise. DAMP offers the same Docker benefits with zero command-line complexity.
    </Callout>
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab value="XAMPP/MAMP">
    ### vs. XAMPP/MAMP
    
    | Feature | DAMP | XAMPP/MAMP |
    |---------|------|-------------|
    | **Isolation** | Fully isolated containers | System-wide installation |
    | **Version Management** | Multiple versions per project | One version system-wide |
    | **System Impact** | Zero system pollution | Modifies system configuration |
    | **Conflicts** | Impossible | Common (ports, versions) |
    | **Modern Workflow** | Docker-native, production-ready | Legacy architecture |
    
    <Callout type="warning">
      **The Verdict**: XAMPP/MAMP are outdated approaches that pollute your system. DAMP provides clean, isolated environments with the flexibility modern development requires.

import { Steps, Step } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/steps';

View, manage, and delete your PHP projects from DAMP's dashboard.

## Project Dashboard

### Project List

All your projects displayed as cards showing:

- **Project Name** - Project identifier
- **Domain** - HTTPS URL (e.g., `myproject.local`)
- **Status Indicator**
  - 🟢 **Running** - DevContainer active
  - 🔴 **Created** - Not yet opened in VS Code
  - ⚪ **Stopped** - DevContainer stopped

<Callout type="info">
  DAMP checks if your DevContainer is running in real-time. Green = accessible via browser.
</Callout>

### Project Details

Click any project card to view full details and actions.

## Project Actions

### Open in VS Code

Launch directly into VS Code:

1. Click "Open in VS Code" button
2. VS Code opens the project
3. Reopen in Container when prompted
4. Start coding

<Callout type="tip">
  This launches your project in VS Code without folder browsing.
</Callout>

### Open Folder

Open the project folder in Windows Explorer:

- View project files
- Copy/paste files
- Backup project manually

### Browse Project

Visit the project in your default browser:

```
https://myproject.local
```

<Callout type="warning">
  Project must be running in VS Code DevContainer to respond to browser requests.
</Callout>

### Environment Variables

View connection information for services:

```
# Database (if MySQL installed)
DB_HOST=damp-mysql
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=development
DB_USERNAME=developer
DB_PASSWORD=devpassword

# Redis (if installed)
REDIS_HOST=damp-redis
REDIS_PORT=6379

# Mail (if Mailpit installed)
MAIL_HOST=damp-mailpit
MAIL_PORT=1025
```

**Copy to Clipboard** - One click copies all environment variables!

## Volume Sync

Named volumes provide **fast performance** but files live in the container. Sync copies them to your local machine.

**Quick Action:**
- **Sync From Volume** - Copy container files to local folder

**Options:**
- Exclude `node_modules/` - Skip Node.js dependencies
- Exclude `vendor/` - Skip PHP dependencies

<Callout type="info">
  See the complete [Volume Sync Guide](/docs/volume-sync) for details on performance, sync timing, and troubleshooting.
</Callout>

## Laravel Tools

Projects marked as Laravel get additional features:

### Open Tinker

Launch Laravel's interactive REPL:

1. Click "Open Tinker" button
2. Terminal opens with Tinker running
3. Test code interactively

```php
>>> User::count()
=> 5

>>> $user = User::first()
>>> $user->name
=> "John Doe"
```

</Step>

<Step>
**Configure (Optional)**

- Choose region (us, eu, ap, etc.)

</Step>

<Step>
**Start Tunnel**

Click "Start Tunnel" - public URL created in seconds
</Step>

</Steps>

**Tunnel URL Example:**

```
https://abc123.ngrok.io → https://myproject.local
```

Share the ngrok URL with clients, testers, or webhooks.

## Deleting Projects

### Safe Deletion

When you delete a project, DAMP:

1. ✅ Stops the DevContainer (if running)
2. ✅ Removes project from DAMP dashboard
3. ✅ Removes domain from hosts file
4. ✅ Removes SSL certificate
5. ✅ Removes Caddy configuration
6. ✅ **Preserves project folder**
7. ✅ **Preserves named volume**

<Callout type="success">
  Your code and data are safe - only DAMP's tracking and configuration are removed.
</Callout>

### Delete Process

<Steps>

<Step>
**Select Project**

Click the project you want to remove
</Step>

<Step>
**Click Delete**

Click "Delete Project" button
</Step>

<Step>
**Confirm**

Confirm deletion in dialog
</Step>

<Step>
**Done**

Project removed from DAMP - folder and volume remain on disk
</Step>

</Steps>

### What Remains After Deletion

Your local filesystem still contains:

```
C:\Users\You\Projects\myproject\    ← Project folder intact
```

Docker volumes still exist:

```bash
docker volume ls
# Shows: myproject_data
```

### Complete Removal

To fully remove everything:

```powershell
# 1. Delete from DAMP (above steps)

# 2. Delete project folder
Remove-Item -Path "C:\Users\You\Projects\myproject" -Recurse -Force

# 3. Delete Docker volume
docker volume rm myproject_data
```

## Bulk Operations

### Refresh All Projects

Click **"Refresh"** button to:
- Update all project statuses
- Check DevContainer states
- Refresh connection info

### Search Projects

Use the search bar to filter projects by name or domain.

<Callout type="tip">
  Keep projects organized with clear naming conventions like `client-project` or `app-v2`.
</Callout>

## Troubleshooting

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="Project Shows 'Created' Instead of 'Running'">
    **Problem:** Project exists but shows red "Created" status

    **Solution:**
    1. Open project in VS Code
    2. Reopen in Container
    3. Wait for DevContainer to fully start
    4. Refresh DAMP
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Project Not Accessible in Browser">
    **Problem:** `https://myproject.local` doesn't load

    **Solutions:**
    - ✅ Check project status is "Running" (green)

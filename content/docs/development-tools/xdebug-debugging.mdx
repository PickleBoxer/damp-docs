import { Step, Steps } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/steps';

Every DAMP project comes with **XDebug pre-configured** and ready to use. Set breakpoints, inspect variables, and step through your code from VS Code.

<Callout type="success">
  XDebug is installed and configured automatically in every project. Press F5 to start debugging.
</Callout>

## Quick Start

Debug your PHP code in three simple steps:

<Steps>

<Step>
**Open Project in DevContainer**

Open your project folder in VS Code and reopen in container.
</Step>

<Step>
**Set Breakpoints**

Click in the gutter next to any line number to add a breakpoint (red dot).
</Step>

<Step>
**Press F5**

Start debugging! VS Code will stop at your breakpoints automatically.
</Step>

</Steps>

## Pre-Configured Setup

### XDebug Configuration

Every project includes `.devcontainer/xdebug.ini`:

```ini
[XDEBUG]
xdebug.mode = develop,debug,trace,coverage,profile
xdebug.start_with_request = trigger
xdebug.client_port = 9003
```

<Callout type="info">
  - **develop,debug** - Full debugging capabilities enabled
  - **trigger** - Debugging starts only when triggered (via browser extension or URL parameter)
  - **9003** - Standard XDebug 3.x port
</Callout>

**Why Trigger Mode?**

Trigger mode means XDebug only activates when you explicitly request it, preventing unnecessary overhead. Use a browser extension or add `?XDEBUG_TRIGGER=1` to URLs to start debugging.

### VS Code Launch Configuration

Included in `.vscode/launch.json`:

```json
{
  "type": "php",
  "request": "launch",
  "name": "Listen for Xdebug",
  "port": 9003,
  "pathMappings": {
    "/workspace/yourproject": "${workspaceFolder}"
  }
}
```

## Debugging Workflows

### Basic Debugging

1. **Set Breakpoint** - Click next to line number
2. **Press F5** - Start debug session
3. **Navigate Code**
   - Access your site in browser
   - XDebug triggers on breakpoint
   - Use debug toolbar to step through

<Callout type="info">
  XDebug is configured with `start_with_request = trigger`, which means debugging only starts when triggered - giving you full control over when to debug.
</Callout>

### Using Browser Extension

The easiest way to trigger XDebug is with a browser extension:

**Chrome/Edge:**
- Install [Xdebug Helper](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/xdebug-helper/eadndfjplgieldjbigjakmdgkmoaaaoc)
- Click the extension icon → Enable "Debug"
- Green bug icon means debugging is active
- Browse your site - breakpoints will trigger

**Firefox:**
- Install [Xdebug Helper](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/xdebug-helper-for-firefox/)
- Same workflow as Chrome version

**Without Extension:**
Add `?XDEBUG_TRIGGER=1` to any URL:
```
https://myapp.local/?XDEBUG_TRIGGER=1
```

### Conditional Breakpoints

Set breakpoints that only trigger when conditions are met:

1. Right-click on breakpoint or gutter
2. Select "Add Conditional Breakpoint"
3. Enter condition (e.g., `$count > 10`)
4. Breakpoint only triggers when condition is true

<Callout type="tip">
  Instead of adding `echo` or `var_dump`, use logpoints. Right-click and select "Add Logpoint" to log messages without modifying code.
</Callout>

## Advanced Features

### Inspecting Variables

**View Current State:**
- Hover over variables in code
- Expand in Variables panel
- See type, value, and structure

**Modify During Debug:**
- Right-click variable in panel
- Select "Set Value"
- Change value and continue execution

### Watch Expressions

Monitor complex expressions:

```php
// Watch these expressions:
$user->name
count($items)
$total > 100
```

Add in Watch panel to track changes throughout execution.

### Exception Breakpoints

Break when exceptions are thrown:

1. Open Breakpoints panel
2. Click "+ Add Exception Breakpoint"
3. Choose exception types
4. Debugger stops on exceptions

## Laravel Debugging

### Artisan Commands

Debug Laravel artisan commands:

```json
{
  "name": "Debug Artisan Command",
  "type": "php",
  "request": "launch",
  "program": "/workspace/yourproject/artisan",
  "args": ["your:command"],
  "cwd": "/workspace/yourproject"
}
```

### Queue Workers

Debug queue jobs:

1. Set breakpoint in job `handle()` method
2. Start debug session (F5)
3. Dispatch job to queue
4. Debugger stops at breakpoint

### Testing

Debug PHPUnit tests:

1. Set breakpoint in test method
2. Run test with coverage
3. Debugger stops at breakpoint in test

## Common Use Cases

### 🐛 Hunting Bugs

Find that elusive bug causing issues:

```php
// Set breakpoint here
public function calculateTotal($items) {
    $total = 0;
    foreach ($items as $item) {
        $total += $item->price; // Inspect $item here
    }
    return $total;
}
```

### 📊 Understanding Flow

Trace execution through complex code:

```php
// Set breakpoints at each step
public function processOrder($order) {
    $this->validate($order);     // Step 1
    $this->charge($order);        // Step 2
    $this->fulfill($order);       // Step 3
    $this->notify($order);        // Step 4
}
```

### 🔍 Inspecting Data

See exact values during runtime:

```php
// What does $data actually contain?
public function transform($data) {
    // Set breakpoint - inspect $data structure
    return $this->mapper->map($data);
}
```

## Customization

### Modify XDebug Settings

Edit `.devcontainer/xdebug.ini` for custom configuration:

```ini
[XDEBUG]
xdebug.mode = develop,debug,trace,coverage,profile
xdebug.start_with_request = trigger
xdebug.client_port = 9003

; Add custom settings:
xdebug.log = /tmp/xdebug.log
xdebug.max_nesting_level = 512
```

**Rebuild Container:**
After changes, rebuild with `Ctrl+Shift+P` → "Dev Containers: Rebuild Container"

<Callout type="warning">
  XDebug configuration changes require a container rebuild to take effect.
</Callout>

## Troubleshooting

<Accordions>

<Accordion title="Breakpoints Not Working">

**Problem**: Debugger doesn't stop at breakpoints

**Solutions:**
1. Verify debug session is active (Debug toolbar visible)
2. **Enable XDebug trigger** - Use browser extension or add `?XDEBUG_TRIGGER=1` to URL
3. Check that XDebug is installed: `php -v` should show "with Xdebug"
4. Ensure path mappings are correct in `launch.json`
5. Try restarting debug session (Shift+F5, then F5)

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Path Mapping Issues">

**Problem**: "Breakpoint ignored - path not found"

**Solution**: Update path mappings in `.vscode/launch.json`:

```json
{
  "pathMappings": {
    "/workspace/yourproject": "${workspaceFolder}"
  }
}
```

Container path must match your workspace folder name.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Port Conflicts">

**Problem**: "Port 9003 already in use"

**Solution**: Another debug session is active. Stop it first (Shift+F5) or change port in `xdebug.ini` and `launch.json`.

</Accordion>

</Accordions>

## How It Works

When you enable Claude Code CLI, DAMP adds this to your `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`:

```json
{
  "features": {
    "ghcr.io/anthropics/devcontainer-features/claude-code:1.0": {}
  }
}
```

<Callout type="info">
  The feature is added during project creation and installed when the devcontainer builds. No manual configuration needed.
</Callout>

## Using Claude Code CLI

### In Terminal

Once your devcontainer is running, use Claude from the terminal:

```bash
# Ask Claude for help
claude "How do I add authentication to this Laravel app?"

# Get code suggestions
claude "Write a function to calculate shipping cost"

# Debug issues
claude "Why is this query slow?"

# Learn patterns
claude "Explain this middleware implementation"
```

### Common Commands

```bash
# General assistance
claude "Explain this file"
claude "How does this feature work?"

# Code generation
claude "Create a user registration controller"
claude "Write tests for this service"

# Refactoring help
claude "How can I improve this code?"
claude "Refactor this function to be more efficient"

# Debugging
claude "Find the bug in this code"
claude "Why am I getting this error?"
```

## Integration Points

### With Your Codebase

Claude Code CLI has context about your project:

- Reads all project files
- Understands dependencies
- Knows your framework (Laravel, etc.)
- Sees your code structure

This provides more relevant suggestions.

### With DevContainer

Claude runs inside your devcontainer:

```
┌──────────────────────────────────┐
│   Your DevContainer              │
├──────────────────────────────────┤
│  • PHP 8.3                       │
│  • Composer                      │
│  • Node.js                       │
│  • Claude Code CLI ✨            │
│  • Your Project Code             │
└──────────────────────────────────┘
```

Same environment, same context.

## Introduction

Get your first DAMP project up and running in under 5 minutes. This guide assumes you have DAMP already installed and are familiar with web development concepts.

<Callout title='Note'>

    New to DAMP? Start with our [installation guide](/docs/installation) first.

</Callout>

## Create Your First Project

<Steps>

1. **Open DAMP**
   
   Launch DAMP from your applications menu or system tray.

2. **Create a new project**
   
   Click the **"New Project"** button in the DAMP dashboard.
   

3. **Choose project type**
   
   Select your project template:
   
   - **Laravel** Recommended badge - Full Laravel framework with MySQL
   - **PHP** - Basic LAMP stack
   - **Existing project** - Bring your own codebase

4. **Configure project**
   
   Fill in the project details:
   
   - **Project Name**: `my-first-app`
   - **Local Domain**: `my-first-app.local` (auto-generated)
   - **PHP Version**: `8.2` (for PHP projects)

5. **Create project**
   
   Click **"Create Project"** and wait for DAMP to:
   - 🔄 Pull required Docker images
   - 🔄 Generate SSL certificates
   - 🔄 Configure local domains
   - 🔄 Start development services
   
   <Callout title="tip">
   First-time setup takes 2-3 minutes as Docker images are downloaded. Subsequent projects start in seconds!
   </Callout>

</Steps>

## Access Your Project

Once creation is complete, your project is immediately available:

### Web Browser
- **HTTPS**: `https://my-first-app.local`

## Open in VS Code

For the best development experience, open your project in VS Code with DevContainer support:

<Steps>

1. **Click "Open in VS Code"**
   
   In the DAMP project dashboard, click the **"Open in VS Code"** button.

2. **Install DevContainer extension** (if prompted)
   
   VS Code will prompt you to install the DevContainer extension if not already installed.

3. **Reopen in container**
   
   VS Code will ask to "Reopen in Container" - click **"Reopen in Container"**.
   
   <Callout title="note">
   This opens your project inside the Docker container with all development tools pre-configured.
   </Callout>

4. **Start coding**
   
   You now have a fully configured development environment with:
   - ✅ PHP/Node.js runtime
   - ✅ Xdebug debugging
   - ✅ Database access
   - ✅ All dependencies installed

</Steps>

## Test Your Setup

Let's verify everything is working correctly:

### Laravel Project Test

If you created a Laravel project:

<Steps>

1. **View the welcome page**
   
   Navigate to `https://my-first-app.local` in your browser. You should see the Laravel welcome page.

2. **Check the database**
   
   Laravel should connect to MySQL automatically. Run a migration:
   
   ```bash
   php artisan migrate
   ```

</Steps>

### Custom Project Test

For other project types:

<Steps>

1. **Check web access**
   
   Visit your project URL and verify the web server is responding.

2. **Test file changes**
   
   Edit a file and verify changes appear immediately (live reload enabled).

3. **Database connection**
   
   Test database connectivity using the provided credentials.

</Steps>

## Next Steps

Your development environment is ready! Here's what to explore next:

**Master these DAMP features for maximum productivity:**

- [**SSL Certificates**](/docs/core-features/automatic-ssl) - Understand HTTPS development
- [**Xdebug Setup**](/docs/development-tools/xdebug-debugging) - Configure debugging
- [**Custom Domains**](/docs/core-features/custom-domains) - Create memorable local URLs

</Card>

### Development Workflow

1. **Project Management**: Use the DAMP dashboard to start/stop services
2. **Code Editing**: Work in VS Code with DevContainer for best experience
3. **Database Management**: Use PHPMyAdmin or your preferred database client
4. **Email Testing**: Check emails in Mailpit during development
5. **Debugging**: Use Xdebug for step-through debugging

### Advanced Features

Once you're comfortable with the basics:

- [**Claude Integration**](/docs/development-tools/claude-code-cli) - AI-powered development

## Troubleshooting

If something isn't working:

1. **Check service status** in the DAMP dashboard
2. **Verify Docker is running** and accessible
3. **Clear browser cache** for SSL certificate issues
4. **Restart the project** if services seem stuck

<Callout title="Pro Tip">
Keep DAMP running in your system tray for quick access to all your projects. You can start/stop individual projects without opening the main interface.
